# WaniKani AI Anime Mnemonic Images Project
This repo contains images of Kanji and radicals that users can generate in anime form with anime girls mostly, either though [NovelAi](https://novelai.net) and [Waifu Diffusion](https://github.com/harubaru/waifu-diffusion).

To contribute, fork this repo, add images in the following format (kanji-(actualkanji).png/jpg/jpeg) and commit the repo. Then create a PR. Also, feel free to create a Greesemonkey script to make these images available for WaniKani reviews.

If you don't know how these images are made, watch this video about AI image generation by [MKDHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCBEumeXY4A)

# Guidelines
Follow these guidelines, or the merge PR will get rejected.
* Images must be safe for work
* Images should be close to the meaning mnemoic on WaniKani as much as possible as AI provides. You can add the reading meaning as well, but that is optional
* If animals are involved, use animal ears instead. AI for Anime image generation is bad at generating animals.
* Images should look acceptable and not break the immersion too much. Avoid images with extra limbs, too much obvious abnormalities, and disfigured faces and proportions. 
* Female characters are preferred over male characters. 

# Copyright
Since images generated by AI [are not copyrightable](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/us-copyright-office-rules-ai-art-cant-be-copyrighted-180979808/) and are not derivative works, any contributions are in the public domain so other learners of Japanese can use them as a study resource.
